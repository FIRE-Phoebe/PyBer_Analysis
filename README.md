# PyBer Analysis

## Overview of the Analysis
PyBer Analysis project uses January to early May of 2019 ride-share data to perform exploratory analysis. We use Panda's libraries, the jupyter Notebook, and Matplotlib to create a variety of visualization to explore the relationship of different city types, drivers and riders as well as the fares. By analyzing these data, we provide recommandations to decision-maker and help Pyber improve access to ride-sharing services.
## Analysis Results
We use city and ride dataset to create piecharts to present the realtionship between different city types and other 3factors: fares, rides and drivers. Based on the city types, we can see that Urban has the most majority of the total fares,total rides and drivers.Comparing to Urban cities, Rural cities has infinitesimal proportion. Suburban cities has roughly half of Urban on the percentage of total fares and rides. However, the % of drivers on Urban is almost 4times greater than Suburban cities.

### Ride-share Result
In order to better summarize our ride-share data, we create data frame based on the Pyber dataset. The following table shows three defferent city types, which are related to Total Rides,Total Drivers, Total Fares, Average fare per Ride and Average Fare per Driver. As we can see, Urban has the highest rides and drivers as well as the total fares; however, the cost for the average fare per ride and average fare per driver are the lowest comparing to Suburban and Rural city types. Comparing to Suburban and Urban, Rural has the lowest total rides and drivers but the cost of fare per ride and fare per driver are very high.

#### Multiple-line Chart for City Types
In addition, we use multiple-line chart to show the date from Jan to April 2019, which is related o the total cost of the fares in Rural, Suburban and Urban cities.

## Summary
Based on the results, provide three business recommendations to CEO for addressing any disparities among the city type.
there is a statement summarizing three business recommendations to the CEO for addressing any disparties among the coty types.
